# Kweh! Discord Bot

Kweh! has been updated to work after the removal of message intent as of 4th September.

To get around the removal, it's now mandatory to @mention Kweh for all commands and replies instead of using prefixes. Hope this change won't cause Kweh! to be too troublesome.

Kweh! before this update has been tagged under release version 1.0.

Happy gaming fellow Eorzeans ~

PS: Didn't expect to get so many dms about Kweh! xD
